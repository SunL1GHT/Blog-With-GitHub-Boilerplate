&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aaswath Raman: How we can turn the cold of outer space into a renewable resource&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if we could use the cold darkness of outer space to cool buildings on earth? In this mind-blowing talk, physicist Aaswath Raman details the technology he's developing to harness "night-sky cooling" -- a natural phenomenon where infrared light escapes earth and heads to space, carrying heat along with it -- which could dramatically reduce the energy used by our cooling systems (and the pollution they cause). Learn more about how this approach could lead us towards a future where we intelligently tap into the energy of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every summer when I was growing up, I would fly from my home in Canada to visit my grandparents, who lived in Mumbai, India. Now, Canadian summers are pretty mild at best -- about 22 degrees Celsius or 72 degrees Fahrenheit is a typical summer's day, and not too hot. Mumbai, on the other hand, is a hot and humid place well into the 30s Celsius or 90s Fahrenheit. As soon as I'd reach it, I'd ask,"How could anyone live, work or sleep in such weather?"To make things worse, my grandparents didn't have an air conditioner. And while I tried my very, very best, I was never able to persuade them to get one. But this is changing, and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooling systems today collectively account for 17 percent of the electricity we use worldwide. This includes everything from the air conditioners I so desperately wanted during my summer vacations, to the refrigeration systems that keep our food safe and cold for us in our supermarkets, to the industrial scale systems that keep our data centers operational. Collectively, these systems account for eight percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what keeps me up at night is that our energy use for cooling might grow sixfold by the year 2050, primarily driven by increasing usage in Asian and African countries. I've seen this firsthand. Nearly every apartment in and around my grandmother's place now has an air conditioner. And that is, emphatically, a good thing for the health, well-being and productivity of people living in warmer climates. However, one of the most alarming things about climate change is that the warmer our planet gets, the more we're going to need cooling systems -- systems that are themselves large emitters of greenhouse gas emissions. This then has the potential to cause a feedback loop, where cooling systems alone could become one of our biggest sources of greenhouse gases later this century. In the worst case, we might need more than 10 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity every year, just for cooling, by the year 2100. That's half our electricity supply today. Just for cooling. But this also point us to an amazing opportunity. A 10 or 20 percent improvement in the efficiency of every cooling system could actually have an enormous impact on our greenhouse gas emissions, both today and later this century. And it could help us avert that worst-case feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a scientist who thinks a lot about light and heat. In particular, how new materials allow us to alter the flow of these basic elements of nature in ways we might have once thought impossible. So, while I always understood the value of cooling during my summer vacations, I actually wound up working on this problem because of an intellectual puzzle that I came across about six years ago. How were ancient peoples able to make ice in desert climates? This is a picture of an ice house, also called a Yakhchal, located in the southwest of Iran. There are ruins of dozens of such structures throughout Iran, with evidence of similar such buildings throughout the rest of the Middle East and all the way to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who operated this ice house many centuries ago, would pour water in the pool you see on the left in the early evening hours, as the sun set. And then something amazing happened. Even though the air temperature might be above freezing, say five degrees Celsius or 41 degrees Fahrenheit, the water would freeze. The ice generated would then be collected in the early morning hours and stored for use in the building you see on the right, all the way through the summer months. You've actually likely seen something very similar at play if you've ever noticed frost form on the ground on a clear night, even when the air temperature is well above freezing. But wait. How did the water freeze if the air temperature is above freezing? Evaporation could have played an effect, but that's not enough to actually cause the water to become ice. Something else must have cooled it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about a pie cooling on a window sill. For it to be able to cool down, its heat needs to flow somewhere cooler. Namely, the air that surrounds it. As implausible as it may sound, for that pool of water, its heat is actually flowing to the cold of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this possible? Well, that pool of water, like most natural materials, sends out its heat as light. This is a concept known as thermal radiation. In fact, we're all sending out our heat as infrared light right now, to each other and our surroundings. We can actually visualize this with thermal cameras and the images they produce, like the ones I'm showing you right now. So that pool of water is sending out its heat upward towards the atmosphere. The atmosphere and the molecules in it absorb some of that heat and send it back. That's actually the greenhouse effect that's responsible for climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's the critical thing to understand. Our atmosphere doesn't absorb all of that heat. If it did, we'd be on a much warmer planet. At certain wavelengths, in particular between eight and 13 microns, our atmosphere has what's known as a transmission window. This window allows some of the heat that goes up as infrared light to effectively escape, carrying away that pool's heat. And it can escape to a place that is much, much colder. The cold of this upper atmosphere and all the way out to outer space, which can be as cold as minus 270 degrees Celsius, or minus 454 degrees Fahrenheit. So that pool of water is able to send out more heat to the sky than the sky sends back to it. And because of that, the pool will cool down below its surroundings' temperature. This is an effect known as night-sky cooling or radiative cooling. And it's always been understood by climate scientists and meteorologists as a very important natural phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I came across all of this, it was towards the end of my PhD at Stanford. And I was amazed by its apparent simplicity as a cooling method, yet really puzzled. Why aren't we making use of this? Now, scientists and engineers had investigated this idea in previous decades. But there turned out to be at least one big problem. It was called night-sky cooling for a reason. Why? Well, it's a little thing called the sun. So, for the surface that's doing the cooling, it needs to be able to face the sky. And during the middle of the day, when we might want something cold the most, unfortunately, that means you're going to look up to the sun. And the sun heats most materials up enough to completely counteract this cooling effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I spend a lot of our time thinking about how we can structure materials at very small length scales such that they can do new and useful things with light -- length scales smaller than the wavelength of light itself. Using insights from this field, known as nanophotonics or metamaterials research, we realized that there might be a way to make this possible during the day for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, I designed a multilayer optical material shown here in a microscope image. It's more than 40 times thinner than a typical human hair. And it's able to do two things simultaneously. First, it sends its heat out precisely where our atmosphere lets that heat out the best. We targeted the window to space. The second thing it does is it avoids getting heated up by the sun. It's a very good mirror to sunlight. The first time I tested this was on a rooftop in Stanford that I'm showing you right here. I left the device out for a little while, and I walked up to it after a few minutes, and within seconds, I knew it was working. How? I touched it, and it felt cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Applause)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to emphasize how weird and counterintuitive this is: this material and others like it will get colder when we take them out of the shade, even though the sun is shining on it. I'm showing you data here from our very first experiment, where that material stayed more than five degrees Celsius, or nine degrees Fahrenheit, colder than the air temperature, even though the sun was shining directly on it. The manufacturing method we used to actually make this material already exists at large volume scales. So I was really excited, because not only do we make something cool, but we might actually have the opportunity to do something real and make it useful. That brings me to the next big question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you actually save energy with this idea? Well, we believe the most direct way to save energy with this technology is as an efficiency boost for today's air-conditioning and refrigeration systems. To do this, we've built fluid cooling panels, like the ones shown right here. These panels have a similar shape to solar water heaters, except they do the opposite -- they cool the water, passively, using our specialized material. These panels can then be integrated with a component almost every cooling system has, called a condenser, to improve the system's underlying efficiency. Our start-up, SkyCool Systems, has recently completed a field trial in Davis, California, shown right here. In that demonstration, we showed that we could actually improve the efficiency of that cooling system as much as 12 percent in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next year or two, I'm super excited to see this go to its first commercial-scale pilots in both the air conditioning and refrigeration space. In the future, we might be able to integrate these kinds of panels with higher efficiency building cooling systems to reduce their energy usage by two-thirds. And eventually, we might actually be able to build a cooling system that requires no electricity input at all. As a first step towards that, my colleagues at Stanford and I have shown that you could actually maintain something more than 42 degrees Celsius below the air temperature with better engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Applause)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So just imagine that -- something that is below freezing on a hot summer's day. So, while I'm very excited about all we can do for cooling, and I think there's a lot yet to be done, as a scientist, I'm also drawn to a more profound opportunity that I believe this work highlights. We can use the cold darkness of space to improve the efficiency of every energy-related process here on earth. One such process I'd like to highlight are solar cells. They heat up under the sun and become less efficient the hotter they are. In 2015, we showed that with deliberate kinds of microstructures on top of a solar cell, we could take better advantage of this cooling effect to maintain a solar cell passively at a lower temperature. This allows the cell to operate more efficiently. We're probing these kinds of opportunities further. We're asking whether we can use the cold of space to help us with water conservation. Or perhaps with off-grid scenarios. Perhaps we could even directly generate power with this cold. There's a large temperature difference between us here on earth and the cold of space. That difference, at least conceptually, could be used to drive something called a heat engine to generate electricity. Could we then make a nighttime power-generation device that generates useful amounts of electricity when solar cells don't work? Could we generate light from darkness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central to this ability is being able to manage the thermal radiation that's all around us. We're constantly bathed in infrared light; if we could bend it to our will, we could profoundly change the flows of heat and energy that permeate around us every single day. This ability, coupled with the cold darkness of space, points us to a future where we, as a civilization, might be able to more intelligently manage our thermal energy footprint at the very largest scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we confront climate change, I believe having this ability in our toolkit will prove to be essential. So, the next time you're walking around outside, yes, do marvel at how the sun is essential to life on earth itself, but don't forget that the rest of the sky has something to offer us as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Applause)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was young, I thought old people had everything figured out. Now that I'm old, I know this isn't true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I constantly feel like a noob. It seems like I'm always talking to some startup working in a new field I know nothing about, or reading a book about a topic I don't understand well enough, or visiting some new country where I don't know how things work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not pleasant to feel like a noob. And the word "noob" is certainly not a compliment. And yet today I realized something encouraging about being a noob: the more of a noob you are locally, the less of a noob you are globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you stay in your home country, you'll feel less of a noob than if you move to Farawavia, where everything works differently. And yet you'll know more if you move. So the feeling of being a noob is inversely correlated with actual ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the feeling of being a noob is good for us, why do we dislike it? What evolutionary purpose could such an aversion serve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the answer is that there are two sources of feeling like a noob: being stupid, and doing something novel. Our dislike of feeling like a noob is our brain telling us "Come on, come on, figure this out." Which was the right thing to be thinking for most of human history. The life of hunter-gatherers was complex, but it didn't change as much as life does now. They didn't suddenly have to figure out what to do about cryptocurrency. So it made sense to be biased toward competence at existing problems over the discovery of new ones. It made sense for humans to dislike the feeling of being a noob, just as, in a world where food was scarce, it made sense for them to dislike the feeling of being hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that too much food is more of a problem than too little, our dislike of feeling hungry leads us astray. And I think our dislike of feeling like a noob does too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it feels unpleasant, and people will sometimes ridicule you for it, the more you feel like a noob, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><author>Garygu9426@gmail.com (Gary)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">/Glog/archives/Being a Noob/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2020 18:13:00 +0806</pubDate></item><item><title>What You'll Wish You'd Known</title><link>/Glog/archives/What You'll Wish You'd Known/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I wrote this talk for a high school. I never actually gave it, because the school authorities vetoed the plan to invite me.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I said I was speaking at a high school, my friends were curious. What will you say to high school students? So I asked them, what do you wish someone had told you in high school? Their answers were remarkably similar. So I'm going to tell you what we all wish someone had told us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll start by telling you something you don't have to know in high school: what you want to do with your life. People are always asking you this, so you think you're supposed to have an answer. But adults ask this mainly as a conversation starter. They want to know what sort of person you are, and this question is just to get you talking. They ask it the way you might poke a hermit crab in a tide pool, to see what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were back in high school and someone asked about my plans, I'd say that my first priority was to learn what the options were. You don't need to be in a rush to choose your life's work. What you need to do is discover what you like. You have to work on stuff you like if you want to be good at what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem that nothing would be easier than deciding what you like, but it turns out to be hard, partly because it's hard to get an accurate picture of most jobs. Being a doctor is not the way it's portrayed on TV. Fortunately you can also watch real doctors, by volunteering in hospitals. [1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are other jobs you can't learn about, because no one is doing them yet. Most of the work I've done in the last ten years didn't exist when I was in high school. The world changes fast, and the rate at which it changes is itself speeding up. In such a world it's not a good idea to have fixed plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet every May, speakers all over the country fire up the Standard Graduation Speech, the theme of which is: don't give up on your dreams. I know what they mean, but this is a bad way to put it, because it implies you're supposed to be bound by some plan you made early on. The computer world has a name for this: premature optimization. And it is synonymous with disaster. These speakers would do better to say simply, don't give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they really mean is, don't get demoralized. Don't think that you can't do what other people can. And I agree you shouldn't underestimate your potential. People who've done great things tend to seem as if they were a race apart. And most biographies only exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how the story ends, they can't help streamlining the plot till it seems like the subject's life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding of some innate genius. In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen year old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they'd seem impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is an uncomfortable thought. If they were just like us, then they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that's one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy. If these guys were able to do what they did only because of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it's not our fault if we can't do something as good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying there's no such thing as genius. But if you're trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we've cut the Standard Graduation Speech down from "don't give up on your dreams" to "what someone else can do, you can do." But it needs to be cut still further. There is &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; variation in natural ability. Most people overestimate its role, but it does exist. If I were talking to a guy four feet tall whose ambition was to play in the NBA, I'd feel pretty stupid saying, you can do anything if you really try. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to cut the Standard Graduation Speech down to, "what someone else with your abilities can do, you can do; and don't underestimate your abilities." But as so often happens, the closer you get to the truth, the messier your sentence gets. We've taken a nice, neat (but wrong) slogan, and churned it up like a mud puddle. It doesn't make a very good speech anymore. But worse still, it doesn't tell you what to do anymore. Someone with your abilities? What are your abilities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upwind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the solution is to work in the other direction. Instead of working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations. This is what most successful people actually do anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the graduation-speech approach, you decide where you want to be in twenty years, and then ask: what should I do now to get there? I propose instead that you don't commit to anything in the future, but just look at the options available now, and choose those that will give you the most promising range of options afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not so important what you work on, so long as you're not wasting your time. Work on things that interest you and increase your options, and worry later about which you'll take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you're a college freshman deciding whether to major in math or economics. Well, math will give you more options: you can go into almost any field from math. If you major in math it will be easy to get into grad school in economics, but if you major in economics it will be hard to get into grad school in math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying a glider is a good metaphor here. Because a glider doesn't have an engine, you can't fly into the wind without losing a lot of altitude. If you let yourself get far downwind of good places to land, your options narrow uncomfortably. As a rule you want to stay upwind. So I propose that as a replacement for "don't give up on your dreams." Stay upwind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you do that, though? Even if math is upwind of economics, how are you supposed to know that as a high school student?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you don't, and that's what you need to find out. Look for smart people and hard problems. Smart people tend to clump together, and if you can find such a clump, it's probably worthwhile to join it. But it's not straightforward to find these, because there is a lot of faking going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a newly arrived undergraduate, all university departments look much the same. The professors all seem forbiddingly intellectual and publish papers unintelligible to outsiders. But while in some fields the papers are unintelligible because they're full of hard ideas, in others they're deliberately written in an obscure way to seem as if they're saying something important. This may seem a scandalous proposition, but it has been experimentally verified, in the famous &lt;em&gt;Social Text&lt;/em&gt; affair. Suspecting that the papers published by literary theorists were often just intellectual-sounding nonsense, a physicist deliberately wrote a paper full of intellectual-sounding nonsense, and submitted it to a literary theory journal, which published it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best protection is always to be working on hard problems. Writing novels is hard. Reading novels isn't. Hard means worry: if you're not worrying that something you're making will come out badly, or that you won't be able to understand something you're studying, then it isn't hard enough. There has to be suspense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this seems a grim view of the world, you may think. What I'm telling you is that you should worry? Yes, but it's not as bad as it sounds. It's exhilarating to overcome worries. You don't see faces much happier than people winning gold medals. And you know why they're so happy? Relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying this is the only way to be happy. Just that some kinds of worry are not as bad as they sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, "stay upwind" reduces to "work on hard problems." And you can start today. I wish I'd grasped that in high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people like to be good at what they do. In the so-called real world this need is a powerful force. But high school students rarely benefit from it, because they're given a fake thing to do. When I was in high school, I let myself believe that my job was to be a high school student. And so I let my need to be good at what I did be satisfied by merely doing well in school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd asked me in high school what the difference was between high school kids and adults, I'd have said it was that adults had to earn a living. Wrong. It's that adults take responsibility for themselves. Making a living is only a small part of it. Far more important is to take intellectual responsibility for oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to go through high school again, I'd treat it like a day job. I don't mean that I'd slack in school. Working at something as a day job doesn't mean doing it badly. It means not being defined by it. I mean I wouldn't think of myself as a high school student, just as a musician with a day job as a waiter doesn't think of himself as a waiter. [3] And when I wasn't working at my day job I'd start trying to do real work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I ask people what they regret most about high school, they nearly all say the same thing: that they wasted so much time. If you're wondering what you're doing now that you'll regret most later, that's probably it. [4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people say this is inevitable-- that high school students aren't capable of getting anything done yet. But I don't think this is true. And the proof is that you're bored. You probably weren't bored when you were eight. When you're eight it's called "playing" instead of "hanging out," but it's the same thing. And when I was eight, I was rarely bored. Give me a back yard and a few other kids and I could play all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason this got stale in middle school and high school, I now realize, is that I was ready for something else. Childhood was getting old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying you shouldn't hang out with your friends-- that you should all become humorless little robots who do nothing but work. Hanging out with friends is like chocolate cake. You enjoy it more if you eat it occasionally than if you eat nothing but chocolate cake for every meal. No matter how much you like chocolate cake, you'll be pretty queasy after the third meal of it. And that's what the malaise one feels in high school is: mental queasiness. [5]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be thinking, we have to do more than get good grades. We have to have &lt;em&gt;extracurricular activities.&lt;/em&gt; But you know perfectly well how bogus most of these are. Collecting donations for a charity is an admirable thing to do, but it's not &lt;em&gt;hard.&lt;/em&gt; It's not getting something done. What I mean by getting something done is learning how to write well, or how to program computers, or what life was really like in preindustrial societies, or how to draw the human face from life. This sort of thing rarely translates into a line item on a college application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corruption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's dangerous to design your life around getting into college, because the people you have to impress to get into college are not a very discerning audience. At most colleges, it's not the professors who decide whether you get in, but admissions officers, and they are nowhere near as smart. They're the NCOs of the intellectual world. They can't tell how smart you are. The mere existence of prep schools is proof of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few parents would pay so much for their kids to go to a school that didn't improve their admissions prospects. Prep schools openly say this is one of their aims. But what that means, if you stop to think about it, is that they can hack the admissions process: that they can take the very same kid and make him seem a more appealing candidate than he would if he went to the local public school. [6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now most of you feel your job in life is to be a promising college applicant. But that means you're designing your life to satisfy a process so mindless that there's a whole industry devoted to subverting it. No wonder you become cynical. The malaise you feel is the same that a producer of reality TV shows or a tobacco industry executive feels. And you don't even get paid a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you do? What you should not do is rebel. That's what I did, and it was a mistake. I didn't realize exactly what was happening to us, but I smelled a major rat. And so I just gave up. Obviously the world sucked, so why bother?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I discovered that one of our teachers was herself using Cliff's Notes, it seemed par for the course. Surely it meant nothing to get a good grade in such a class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect this was stupid. It was like someone getting fouled in a soccer game and saying, hey, you fouled me, that's against the rules, and walking off the field in indignation. Fouls happen. The thing to do when you get fouled is not to lose your cool. Just keep playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By putting you in this situation, society has fouled you. Yes, as you suspect, a lot of the stuff you learn in your classes is crap. And yes, as you suspect, the college admissions process is largely a charade. But like many fouls, this one was unintentional. [7] So just keep playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebellion is almost as stupid as obedience. In either case you let yourself be defined by what they tell you to do. The best plan, I think, is to step onto an orthogonal vector. Don't just do what they tell you, and don't just refuse to. Instead treat school as a day job. As day jobs go, it's pretty sweet. You're done at 3 o'clock, and you can even work on your own stuff while you're there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curiosity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what's your real job supposed to be? Unless you're Mozart, your first task is to figure that out. What are the great things to work on? Where are the imaginative people? And most importantly, what are you interested in? The word "aptitude" is misleading, because it implies something innate. The most powerful sort of aptitude is a consuming interest in some question, and such interests are often acquired tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distorted version of this idea has filtered into popular culture under the name "passion." I recently saw an ad for waiters saying they wanted people with a "passion for service." The real thing is not something one could have for waiting on tables. And passion is a bad word for it. A better name would be curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids are curious, but the curiosity I mean has a different shape from kid curiosity. Kid curiosity is broad and shallow; they ask why at random about everything. In most adults this curiosity dries up entirely. It has to: you can't get anything done if you're always asking why about everything. But in ambitious adults, instead of drying up, curiosity becomes narrow and deep. The mud flat morphs into a well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity turns work into play. For Einstein, relativity wasn't a book full of hard stuff he had to learn for an exam. It was a mystery he was trying to solve. So it probably felt like less work to him to invent it than it would seem to someone now to learn it in a class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most dangerous illusions you get from school is the idea that doing great things requires a lot of discipline. Most subjects are taught in such a boring way that it's only by discipline that you can flog yourself through them. So I was surprised when, early in college, I read a quote by Wittgenstein saying that he had no self-discipline and had never been able to deny himself anything, not even a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I know a number of people who do great work, and it's the same with all of them. They have little discipline. They're all terrible procrastinators and find it almost impossible to make themselves do anything they're not interested in. One still hasn't sent out his half of the thank-you notes from his wedding, four years ago. Another has 26,000 emails in her inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying you can get away with zero self-discipline. You probably need about the amount you need to go running. I'm often reluctant to go running, but once I do, I enjoy it. And if I don't run for several days, I feel ill. It's the same with people who do great things. They know they'll feel bad if they don't work, and they have enough discipline to get themselves to their desks to start working. But once they get started, interest takes over, and discipline is no longer necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think Shakespeare was gritting his teeth and diligently trying to write Great Literature? Of course not. He was having fun. That's why he's so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity about a promising question. The critical moment for Einstein was when he looked at Maxwell's equations and said, what the hell is going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can take years to zero in on a productive question, because it can take years to figure out what a subject is really about. To take an extreme example, consider math. Most people think they hate math, but the boring stuff you do in school under the name "mathematics" is not at all like what mathematicians do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great mathematician G. H. Hardy said he didn't like math in high school either. He only took it up because he was better at it than the other students. Only later did he realize math was interesting-- only later did he start to ask questions instead of merely answering them correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a friend of mine used to grumble because he had to write a paper for school, his mother would tell him: find a way to make it interesting. That's what you need to do: find a question that makes the world interesting. People who do great things look at the same world everyone else does, but notice some odd detail that's compellingly mysterious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not only in intellectual matters. Henry Ford's great question was, why do cars have to be a luxury item? What would happen if you treated them as a commodity? Franz Beckenbauer's was, in effect, why does everyone have to stay in his position? Why can't defenders score goals too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it takes years to articulate great questions, what do you do now, at sixteen? Work toward finding one. Great questions don't appear suddenly. They gradually congeal in your head. And what makes them congeal is experience. So the way to find great questions is not to search for them-- not to wander about thinking, what great discovery shall I make? You can't answer that; if you could, you'd have made it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to get a big idea to appear in your head is not to hunt for big ideas, but to put in a lot of time on work that interests you, and in the process keep your mind open enough that a big idea can take roost. Einstein, Ford, and Beckenbauer all used this recipe. They all knew their work like a piano player knows the keys. So when something seemed amiss to them, they had the confidence to notice it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put in time how and on what? Just pick a project that seems interesting: to master some chunk of material, or to make something, or to answer some question. Choose a project that will take less than a month, and make it something you have the means to finish. Do something hard enough to stretch you, but only just, especially at first. If you're deciding between two projects, choose whichever seems most fun. If one blows up in your face, start another. Repeat till, like an internal combustion engine, the process becomes self-sustaining, and each project generates the next one. (This could take years.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be just as well not to do a project "for school," if that will restrict you or make it seem like work. Involve your friends if you want, but not too many, and only if they're not flakes. Friends offer moral support (few startups are started by one person), but secrecy also has its advantages. There's something pleasing about a secret project. And you can take more risks, because no one will know if you fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't worry if a project doesn't seem to be on the path to some goal you're supposed to have. Paths can bend a lot more than you think. So let the path grow out the project. The most important thing is to be excited about it, because it's by doing that you learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't disregard unseemly motivations. One of the most powerful is the desire to be better than other people at something. Hardy said that's what got him started, and I think the only unusual thing about him is that he admitted it. Another powerful motivator is the desire to do, or know, things you're not supposed to. Closely related is the desire to do something audacious. Sixteen year olds aren't supposed to write novels. So if you try, anything you achieve is on the plus side of the ledger; if you fail utterly, you're doing no worse than expectations. [8]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware of bad models. Especially when they excuse laziness. When I was in high school I used to write "existentialist" short stories like ones I'd seen by famous writers. My stories didn't have a lot of plot, but they were very deep. And they were less work to write than entertaining ones would have been. I should have known that was a danger sign. And in fact I found my stories pretty boring; what excited me was the idea of writing serious, intellectual stuff like the famous writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have enough experience to realize that those famous writers actually sucked. Plenty of famous people do; in the short term, the quality of one's work is only a small component of fame. I should have been less worried about doing something that seemed cool, and just done something I liked. That's the actual road to coolness anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key ingredient in many projects, almost a project on its own, is to find good books. Most books are bad. Nearly all textbooks are bad. [9] So don't assume a subject is to be learned from whatever book on it happens to be closest. You have to search actively for the tiny number of good books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing is to get out there and do stuff. Instead of waiting to be taught, go out and learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your life doesn't have to be shaped by admissions officers. It could be shaped by your own curiosity. It is for all ambitious adults. And you don't have to wait to start. In fact, you don't have to wait to be an adult. There's no switch inside you that magically flips when you turn a certain age or graduate from some institution. You start being an adult when you decide to take responsibility for your life. You can do that at any age. [10]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may sound like bullshit. I'm just a minor, you may think, I have no money, I have to live at home, I have to do what adults tell me all day long. Well, most adults labor under restrictions just as cumbersome, and they manage to get things done. If you think it's restrictive being a kid, imagine having kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only real difference between adults and high school kids is that adults realize they need to get things done, and high school kids don't. That realization hits most people around 23. But I'm letting you in on the secret early. So get to work. Maybe you can be the first generation whose greatest regret from high school isn't how much time you wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] A doctor friend warns that even this can give an inaccurate picture. "Who knew how much time it would take up, how little autonomy one would have for endless years of training, and how unbelievably annoying it is to carry a beeper?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] His best bet would probably be to become dictator and intimidate the NBA into letting him play. So far the closest anyone has come is Secretary of Labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3] A day job is one you take to pay the bills so you can do what you really want, like play in a band, or invent relativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treating high school as a day job might actually make it easier for some students to get good grades. If you treat your classes as a game, you won't be demoralized if they seem pointless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However bad your classes, you need to get good grades in them to get into a decent college. And that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; worth doing, because universities are where a lot of the clumps of smart people are these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4] The second biggest regret was caring so much about unimportant things. And especially about what other people thought of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what they really mean, in the latter case, is caring what random people thought of them. Adults care just as much what other people think, but they get to be more selective about the other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have about thirty friends whose opinions I care about, and the opinion of the rest of the world barely affects me. The problem in high school is that your peers are chosen for you by accidents of age and geography, rather than by you based on respect for their judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5] The key to wasting time is distraction. Without distractions it's too obvious to your brain that you're not doing anything with it, and you start to feel uncomfortable. If you want to measure how dependent you've become on distractions, try this experiment: set aside a chunk of time on a weekend and sit alone and think. You can have a notebook to write your thoughts down in, but nothing else: no friends, TV, music, phone, IM, email, Web, games, books, newspapers, or magazines. Within an hour most people will feel a strong craving for distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6] I don't mean to imply that the only function of prep schools is to trick admissions officers. They also generally provide a better education. But try this thought experiment: suppose prep schools supplied the same superior education but had a tiny (.001) negative effect on college admissions. How many parents would still send their kids to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might also be argued that kids who went to prep schools, because they've learned more, &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; better college candidates. But this seems empirically false. What you learn in even the best high school is rounding error compared to what you learn in college. Public school kids arrive at college with a slight disadvantage, but they start to pull ahead in the sophomore year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I'm not saying public school kids are smarter than preppies, just that they are within any given college. That follows necessarily if you agree prep schools improve kids' admissions prospects.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7] Why does society foul you? Indifference, mainly. There are simply no outside forces pushing high school to be good. The air traffic control system works because planes would crash otherwise. Businesses have to deliver because otherwise competitors would take their customers. But no planes crash if your school sucks, and it has no competitors. High school isn't evil; it's random; but random is pretty bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8] And then of course there is money. It's not a big factor in high school, because you can't do much that anyone wants. But a lot of great things were created mainly to make money. Samuel Johnson said "no man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money." (Many hope he was exaggerating.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[9] Even college textbooks are bad. When you get to college, you'll find that (with a few stellar exceptions) the textbooks are not written by the leading scholars in the field they describe. Writing college textbooks is unpleasant work, done mostly by people who need the money. It's unpleasant because the publishers exert so much control, and there are few things worse than close supervision by someone who doesn't understand what you're doing. This phenomenon is apparently &lt;a href="http://www.edutopia.org/muddle-machine"&gt;even worse&lt;/a&gt; in the production of high school textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[10] Your teachers are always telling you to behave like adults. I wonder if they'd like it if you did. You may be loud and disorganized, but you're very docile compared to adults. If you actually started acting like adults, it would be just as if a bunch of adults had been transposed into your bodies. Imagine the reaction of an FBI agent or taxi driver or reporter to being told they had to ask permission to go the bathroom, and only one person could go at a time. To say nothing of the things you're taught. If a bunch of actual adults suddenly found themselves trapped in high school, the first thing they'd do is form a union and renegotiate all the rules with the administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks&lt;/strong&gt; to Ingrid Bassett, Trevor Blackwell, Rich Draves, Dan Giffin, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough, Robert Morris, Mark Nitzberg, Lisa Randall, and Aaron Swartz for reading drafts of this, and to many others for talking to me about high school.&lt;/p&gt;

文章末尾的话是：反思坚持不下的原因：&lt;strong&gt;忘记&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不想忘记，想时常牢记，共勉吧，愿我们在以后的人生道路上能有所成就。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;转眼即将毕业，对入职亦或者升学都充满了期待。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从知乎上看到网友分享的入职前的准备，摘抄下来，同大家一块学习。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;一定要熟练运用office软件。特别是&lt;strong&gt;excel&lt;/strong&gt;，透视图部分和vlookup部分；会受用多年。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;要多带些便携版软件zip，画修图软件：AI， PS, origin；&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;流程图软件：visio；&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;脑图软件：xmind；&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;一礼拜之内，上手所有办公设备，不限于：打印复印传真设备、会议系统、电话系统。不仅要会用，而且能解决常见毛病。这点保证你成为办公室的一把好刀，很容易塑造干练形象，时不时还能做个意外百分百的解围高手。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;从第一天开始写&lt;strong&gt;工作日志&lt;/strong&gt;，一礼拜5天,每月浏览一次。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;内容包括：本月关键任务的进展/今天遇到的难题和解决思路/今天最重要的3条心得/如果时间倒流，今天最希望改变的一件事是什么。 每天看着自己的进步，并把主要事件记录归纳，你会感谢自己的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;每天抽出下班后的半个小时写总结&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;信息管理习惯，对每天接触的，管理的，完成的信息，进行分类。按&lt;strong&gt;项目+日期&lt;/strong&gt;或者类别分类。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从第一天开始，&lt;strong&gt;养成信息管理习惯&lt;/strong&gt;，把个人所有的工作输出按&lt;strong&gt;项目、日期或类别&lt;/strong&gt;，归类到文件夹。写年终总结和简历的时候，你会大笑三声。注意两星期备份一次（最好用云盘，最次用U盘，不能带走就在几个分区都备份一遍），防止意外。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;列清单&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;工作中任何方面都需要清单。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;维护一份接触过的优秀供应商清单，不断更新替换，要有价格、优劣势、联系方式。包括但不限于：优质酒店、风味馆子、代开发票的、代办合法证件的、礼品制作、广告印刷、活动策划、汽车租赁、物流快递员。关键时刻，会给你惊喜。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;细节，整理好内务，结束一项任务，一天的工作后，写结论，接下的计划，不能断掉思路。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;每天下班前整理桌面，上班前清洗水杯。工作环境的细节反映你的生活追求&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;尊重&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;认真跟保洁阿姨、保安打招呼。你对他们的尊重，会换来意想不到的信息。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;递矿泉水前，为女同事拧松瓶盖。好感度暴增。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;准备、细节&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不论是不是组织者，尽量开会前早到，准备好所有的设备、材料、自己的发言稿。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;让每一次公开会议成为你的专业show场，展现职业化和准备度。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;增加曝光率，增加曝光率，增加曝光率。任何形式，任何人，不要胆怯。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;对待加班，从一开始就要做好心理建设，年轻人在这点上容易心态失衡。你这个年纪，掌握的资源和方法根本不能实现“我超高效率，8小时足够解决工作难题”。20几岁拿时间换效率，攒经验值，是为了30几岁少拼命。实在没事儿你就在办公室写日志吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;延续上条，常备行军床、舒服的枕头、空调毯，时刻做好加班准备。要知道overtime总是难免的，你又何苦扑桌上睡。对自己的腰好一点，你媳妇儿需要你。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;柜子里常备能充饥的健康食物，没时间吃饭就啃：麦片、坚果、粗粮饼干、家里煮的红薯。不要咖啡，影响心率。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;用&lt;strong&gt;QQ邮箱&lt;/strong&gt;（Outlook只能做邮件提醒，Google日历已墙）把未来一年将遇到的&lt;strong&gt;大事&lt;/strong&gt;、&lt;strong&gt;要事&lt;/strong&gt;、&lt;strong&gt;同事生日&lt;/strong&gt;、&lt;strong&gt;家庭纪念日&lt;/strong&gt;，设置好短信提醒（free）、微信提醒（free）和邮箱提醒，提醒时间至少提前2周，留足时间余量做准备。老板会赞你：这孩子很有规划性。哪有什么未雨绸缪，你不过就是把别人啃猪蹄的时间拿来设日历了。每个月注意更新日历。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;一到两年之后，你大概会有下属、后辈或带实习生，把我提到的办公技巧教给他，经常夸夸他。你可以开始摸索从事务工作里解脱，往新的阶段走吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;前几个月工资存起来买部 iPad / Kindle，实实在在的用来看书，这会是你职场前3年最超值的投资。务必养成电子化阅读的习惯啊同学，这是信息社会的大势所趋，避无可避。每个月至少读1-2本专业书，心得写到工作日志里。别问我哪下书，影印PDF找&lt;strong&gt;新浪V盘&lt;/strong&gt;、&lt;strong&gt;百度云&lt;/strong&gt;，其他格式去多看、亚马逊买正版。管理类入门可以参考我这个高票答案（/认真脸）：&lt;a href="http://www.zhihu.com/question/20212656/answer/23482587"&gt;「哪些管理类的书籍值得推荐？」&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;阅读器根据自己的喜好选，诚心推荐iPad，沉浸式阅读跟设备是啥没关系。6英寸的Kindle读读小说杂文大概没问题，专业领域的图书都是大开本的PDF，往往附有大量图形图表，即时用了多看的PDF裁剪，也会是场灾难（评论里有司考同学的血泪史）。大屏彩色阅读器，so easy。耶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;接上条，注意护眼。真正的不伤眼，跟阅读器是不是E-link屏幕没关系，温和的光线、合适的字号，还有闭眼休息才是护眼的王道。眼睛要是看坏了，晚上做事真的很不方便，你懂的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;用多平台支持的阅读App，&lt;strong&gt;「多看阅读 」、「Kindle阅读软件 」、&lt;/strong&gt;限时只卖一块钱&lt;strong&gt;「Good Reader 」&lt;/strong&gt;必装，Good Reader涨价就用国产替补&lt;strong&gt;「福昕阅读器 」吧。「新浪V盘」&lt;/strong&gt;，神器必装，里面下的书可以用其他软件打开。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;不要因为工作错过家庭的重要时刻，包括但不限于:亲人生日、结婚纪念日、孩子毕业典礼等。无法避免的话，一要做好提前解释，二要事后弥补。别让忽视常态化，你家庭生活中的所有裂痕和不快最终都会投射到你的工作里。阿里管理顾问杨国安教授说滴好哇，工作生活太难平衡，唯一的王道就是：多有存款，不要错过纪念日。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;多和同事分享零食。极其有效的提升团队氛围，营造很cozy的感觉，谁用谁知道。喂，那位同学，放下妹纸的零食，我是要你买呀。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;邮件的收件人我一定放到最后再填。没有收件人无法发出，这就给你检查邮件提供了第一步的防错。然后我会做一个checklist作为二次加固，贴在电脑旁边，逐一核对并脑补打勾的动作：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 1 &lt;strong&gt;正文 checking：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;□ 发送对象的称谓、职位是否正确？（上班第一个月的邮件2次写错高层领导的职位，那酸爽~）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;□ 正文错别字是否检查，确保无误？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;□ 观点、论据和要follow-up的事项是否表达清楚？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;□ 签名档是否完整&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;□ 邮件内容是否还需leader审核&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2 &lt;strong&gt;附件 checking：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;□ 如有附件，是否已经附上？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;□ 附件中内容再看一遍。确保收件人打开附件后，光标停在最需要看到的地方。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;□ 文档格式是否能兼容收件人的版本（一定要熟悉领导的office版本，保险措施存office 2003）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3 &lt;strong&gt;收件人/抄送人 checking：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;□ 开始填写收件人、抄送人&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;□ 是否有漏掉的收件人？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;□ 是否有抄送人，普通抄送还是密送？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;□ 收件/抄送人邮箱是否拼写错误？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 4 &lt;strong&gt;发送&lt;/strong&gt;（同学，再看一遍附件漏没漏啊）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;好奇宝宝一般是招人喜欢的，因为好为人师是天性。但是，注意这个但是啊。不管跟同事还是领导提问题，确保自己要能提出1-2个想法或者解决思路，甭管对不对，至少不会显得你是个没有基本思考能力的愣头青。幼稚蠢萌，比起文傻来，还是好几个段位的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;开始培养权衡思维，关注财务状况。怎么做呢，就是&lt;strong&gt;花费时间、金钱前要衡量投入、产出。&lt;/strong&gt;比如打游戏和写代码，对你可能都是有益的，但前者产出少、影响身体所以分配的时间要控制，后者能提升赚钱（生存）能力，工作之外可以多花时间，to live better。当然，认为游戏、娱乐纯属无益的苦行主义，我是反对的，&lt;strong&gt;人生需要这样的“浪费”，一如小电影前的剧情前戏。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;接上条，关注财务可不是要你抠啊。有些事千万别抠，能花钱买时间的坚决花，能丰富自己生活、培养喜好特长的东西，稍微考虑下就买买买吧，学个乐器，拍拍照，画点小画，收集有趣的玩物，即时最后没有坚持，也是多了味道和点缀。生活不易，太值了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;要关注生活细节，感知时间的流动。做笔记，写生活日志，画画摄影，别让年龄在工作里毫无痕迹的流失。&lt;strong&gt;忽视生活的实感&lt;/strong&gt;，这是我个人在最初几年，&lt;strong&gt;觉得最后悔的事情。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;关注自己的身体，做好意外防范。如果你工作在BAT这样的企业，当然要恭喜你可以获得比较完善的人身福利：年度体检、意外/人寿/补充医疗保险。如果没有，就要爱自己多一点了，&lt;strong&gt;饮食少糖少盐&lt;/strong&gt;，每年至少一次&lt;strong&gt;全面体检&lt;/strong&gt;，买一份承担得起的&lt;strong&gt;商业保险&lt;/strong&gt;。假设，我说假设，有了意外，也是给自己一次抵抗命运的机会，给家人一点经济上的宽慰。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;反思坚持不下的原因:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;忘记！！&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;请回答1988无疑是我至今为止看过最认真的一部韩剧，里面的各个人物都很立体形象，尤其是正焕，最是引起自己的共鸣。同时感谢&lt;a href="https://space.bilibili.com/927587/favlist?fid=819487187&amp;amp;ftype=create"&gt;木鱼先生&lt;/a&gt;能给我带来这么好的作品。
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;木鱼系列影评摘录&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;【木鱼微剧场】《请回答1988》最好的韩剧，刷N遍依然感动&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;【木鱼微剧场】最好的韩剧《请回答1988》：德善的初恋&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;【木鱼微剧场】最好的韩剧《请回答1988》：关于暗恋这件小事&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;【木鱼微剧场】最好的韩剧《请回答1988》：爱一个人，请在变成遗憾之前…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;【木鱼微剧场】最好的韩剧《请回答1988》：喜欢一个人的理由&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;【木鱼微剧场】最好的韩剧《请回答1988》：当你犹犹豫豫不敢表白的时候…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;所谓爱一个人，不是宽裕后才想要给予&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而是不管什么时候，不论什么条件都恳切地必须给予&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所谓爱一个人，并不是喜欢对方的体温&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而是要努力地让自己的体温跟对方的体温越来越近&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所谓爱一个人，就是对方一直折磨你&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;你一直想让自己去讨厌对方，却怎么都讨厌不起来&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;评论之评论&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;这部剧对我来说最大的吸引点就是能让你反思自己，好比看书的感觉，看到某些文字与某些感动瞬间会让人联想以前发生的事，也会带给你正确的三观，剧中主人公都是比较普通人，家庭并不富裕，正是因为这种普通人的生活接地气，生活上有时感觉跟自己的童年能产生共鸣，获得一些精神慰藉。这部片适合小孩、大人观看，关于普通人的青春期、中年期五户家庭的点滴成长，诠释了什么亲情、友情、爱情的真善美。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;正焕这个角色真的深入人心，得知最后的结局让我止步在11集德善求正焕一起去听演唱会的时候。给自己一种她曾经也喜欢过我的暗示。在我人生中最重要的第二个阶段里让我遇见这么温暖我心的电视剧，我决定把它定格在最感动我的时刻。等我度过这段决定人生高度的时期，我一定带上心爱的人一起享受和重温这部1988。在此之前也让我有更加坚定的信念和明确的心意。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;我的2020&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;四月不只是四月&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;记录下这个四月，没有神奇荒诞，也没有天长地久。有的只是不断地怠惰……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;四月的意义，在于《四月是你的谎言》中的经典，在于老故人的生日，在于春天的开始，在于校园生活的开始，也是一个承诺结束。但措手不及的疫情让所有的美好都丧失了原本的风味，我也开始了一如既往的消沉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;春天开始，万物复苏，整个中国大地也在疫情的洗礼下重获新生。四月，我们几个好友去了野餐、庆祝了生日，一起相聚，一起玩笑。但这些原本美好的事物也并没有带走三月我的消极情绪，我仍然郁郁。从前发誓不再接触的电子竞技比赛，现在又沉浸其中；从前发誓要努力改变的作息，现在变成了熬夜；从前买来要变为生产力的ipad，现在也不过是一种学习工具；从前想要不断完善的毕业设计，现在也沦落到一筹莫展的地步；从前考完试想要干的事，现在只想偏安一隅。什么岁月静好，什么平安喜乐，都不过是成王败寇。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在我逃避偷懒的时候，同学们在学习，在我放纵娱乐的时候，同学们在学习，在我打闹游玩的时候，同学们在学习。可能会觉得为什么你的同学们都这么优秀，他们不休息的吗？是的，他们认真起来真的很认真。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;马上迎接五月。不能舍弃一些基本的计划，因为计划就像是骨架，支撑着整个系统，否则就会像现在一样一滩烂泥。偶尔也要记录一下生活吧，文字中间夹杂一些文字什么的。记住，同时做好许多事很难，但是坚持做好一件事，并不难。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure  size-undefined&gt;&lt;img width="-1" height="-1" src="https://i.loli.net/2020/04/26/3HmusngS6Lw9jYh.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;整个四月最好的消息&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;昨天收到了上海大学的复试确认通知，正印证了努力不一定会有回报，但不努力是一定不会有所收获的道理。不想成为所谓的"败犬"！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今天老金收到了十四所的录取通知，可喜可贺。#0427&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在一个炎热的夏天，父子两人和约翰夫妇骑摩托车从明尼苏达到加州，跨越美国大陆，旅行的过程与一个青年斐德洛研修科学技术与西方经典，寻求自我的解脱，以及探寻生命的意义的过程相互穿插。一路上父亲以一场哲学肖陶扩的形式，将见到的自然景色，野外露营的经历，夜晚旅店的谈话，机车修护技术等等日常生活与西方从苏格拉底以来的理性哲学的深入浅出的阐述与评论相结合，进行了对形而上学传统的主客体二元论的反思，以及对科学与艺术，知识与价值，古典主义与浪漫主义，精神与物质，机械论与神秘主义，西方与东方等西方二分法划分下的事物间的关系的思考。并潜入自己的过去，探寻在现代文明下自己精神的分裂的起源，完成了一次自我心灵与人类文明的探索。&lt;/p&gt;
